Google Member Map
Introduction

This mod installs a member map to your website which allows your members to pin their location on a map. It uses Google Maps 3.0 API to generate the map and place 'Push" pins. 

Simply install this package through the package manager located in your Administration Panel. Manual edits may be required if your site uses a custom theme. This mod is compatible with SMF 2.0

In your admin panel you will need to enable it and set any customization you like. Next, your members will need to edit their profiles and place a pin on the map to show their location and save their profile. That pin will then display on the main member map page. The admin will also need to set the map permissions so users can see and use it.
